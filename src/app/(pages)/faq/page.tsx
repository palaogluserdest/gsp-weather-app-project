    question: 'How does our service work?',
    answer:
      'Our service provides a 6-day weather forecast for any location you type into the search bar. The displayed weather cards are collapsible; you can click on them to see more detailed information for each day. If you sign in, you can add or remove locations from your favorites. Additionally, you can update your personal information on the profile page.',

    question: 'How do I add or remove locations from my favorites?',
    answer:
      'Once signed in, youâ€™ll see favorite icons next to each location. An empty star indicates the location is not in your favorites, while a filled star means it is. Your favorite locations will be displayed below the search bar. To remove a location from favorites, simply click on it to bring it up on the screen, then click the favorite icon to remove it.',
